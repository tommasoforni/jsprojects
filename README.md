# jsprojects
A collection of Javascript projects I made to learn some js, html and css.

index.html is the main page that leads to the other projects. It can be visualized at [this link](https://rawcdn.githack.com/tommasoforni/jsprojects/782752f2d9d3cac0f216f5b7f41e7412a5dbae32/index.html)

gravity.html is a newtonian gravity 2D simulator written in JavaScript using p5.js. It can be visualized at [this link](https://rawcdn.githack.com/tommasoforni/jsprojects/782752f2d9d3cac0f216f5b7f41e7412a5dbae32/gravity/gravity.html)
